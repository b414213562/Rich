I just released a patch for the Rich! plugin: [url=https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=1249]Rich! patch consolidation and interactive map[/url]

This patch combines the other Rich! patches (French and German languages, updated barter items, and multiple item stacks), and adds an interactive map.

This patch includes an interactive map. Click "Map" on the main window to open it.

The Rich! interactive map shows you the known locations of dig-sites, and lets you visualize how effective a cave-claw will be from your position. When you click the "Detect Location" button, you will see a yellow circle showing you which dig-sites will be examined by a cave-claw, if you release it from where you are. (Note: Sometimes a cave-claw goes well outside the expected 20 meter range. My current working theory is that you can critically succeed on your cave-claw, and it will get a boost to its range.)

Rich! cannot detect when you actually use a cave-claw. Just click the "Detect Location" and then "Mark Cave-claw" buttons when you deploy a cave-claw, and Rich! will remember where you were. When you get the cave-claw report, it will indicate that the best the cave-claw found was either small, medium, large, or huge. There are corresponding buttons in the "Cave-claw result:" row. This uses the standard Quality color-coding: yellow for small, purple for medium, cyan for large.

You can also click a dig site to mark it as complete (either because you dug it up or because you do not want to.) If you mark a cave-claw as Small, all dig sites in that area are automatically marked complete, as usually you do not want to dig up small sites.

The map automatically resets when a round begins. If you need to reset it manually, click the "Reset Map" button.
