[URL="https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info694-Rich.html"]Rich![/URL] is a great interface for keeping track of things during the Buried Treasure Event. However, the plugin's barter list has drifted out of synch with the available in-game barter items.

This patch updates the barter items based on the 2021-09-30 Buried Treasure Event.

This patch is compatible with Egarthur's [URL="https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1215-PatchtoRich--Itemsandtokensbugfixesenhancements.html"]'Patch to Rich! -- Items and tokens bugfixes/enhancements' version 1.2.1.2[/URL].

To install:
[LIST]
[*]First, you need to install [URL="https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info694-Rich.html"]Rich![/URL] v1.2.1. This patch only includes the necessary changes to update that plugin. To install Rich!, you can use [URL="https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html"]Plugin Compendium[/URL]. To install it manually, click the Download button on the Rich! page, unzip the archive, and drag the "GaluhadPlugins" folder into your "Documents/The Lord of the Rings Online/Plugins" folder. (If you have not previously installed any plugins, you will have to first create the Plugins folder.)
[*]Next, download this patch and unzip it. It also contains a "GaluhadPlugins" folder, which you should drag into the same place as before. You will be prompted to overwrite files. Answer yes.
[/LIST]

To load the plugin, use the game's built-in Plugin Manager. This can be found in the "^" menu, at the bottom of the screen, or by typing [B]/plugin manager[/B] into your chat window.

When the Plugin Manager opens, find Rich! in the list on the left side. Verify that the version is 1.2.1.1. (If it is 1.2.1, then you have not properly installed the patch.) Click "Load" to load the plugin. If you would like the plugin to load automatically each time you login, choose your character's name in the "Automatically Load For" pulldown menu.
